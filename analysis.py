#in retrospect, this task is like (not binary but b-)tree reconstruction given
#many nodes with pointers to children (retweet ids and ids). We could end up
#with many trees, of various degrees of bushiness and depth, and we have no idea
#which elements are the roots of each tree. But perhaps that approach would be
#better than lists of lists, as below, which represent paths to leaves from
#higher nodes that may or may not be roots.
